# Airbnb

### Likes
+ "infinite scroll"
+ lots of pictures and severall examples as soon as you open the site
+ price is easy to see
+ nice categoryfiltering "beach, cabin, pools, popular etc" and love the icons that are used
+ modal for more filtering such as a price range, bedrooms, single room or the whole place
+ When searching for a place a map arrives, and that is very cool
+ sticky nav
+ when in desktop and clikcing on a place you open a new window, but that doesn't happen in mobile view
+ haveing an "experiences" tab is really cool. I ended up using a lot of time seeing what's happening around where I live

#### desktop
+ 6 per row

#### mobile
+ the slider for the categories


### Dislikes
+ A lot of categories, and most of them seem less important to me, barn is one of the first five, and popular is at number 14
+ In the "where" category, the regions that come up are Souteast-Asia, Usa, South America, Italy, Spain or I am flexible, and in mobile you have a bit more. You can search, but it doesn't look like it due to the normal blinking line is missing in desktop.
+ When choosing dates, its hard to see that the days between are also highlighted. 
+ Not a fan of using red/pink for the main color
+ The constant refreshing on the map was a bit annoying for my part
+ I chose a highest price of 250,- but would still get nights as expensive as 533,-
#### desktop
+ would have been nice with an animated hover effect, instead of just going between two states 
#### mobile
+ going in the map was quite easy, but getting out was more difficult, wish that there was a button for it instead of the sliding.

## Final Thoughts
A site that's quick and easy to use, you get the most important information without haveing to really leave the page, you can quickly see different places that interest you, and decide to check one or the other out based on the photos, price, and rating.
I think that the system for which the categories is placed is a bit mismanaged, as mentioned above you have "popular" at number 14, behind barn by 9 places aswell as just an extreme amount of categories that you have to go through, and you have "on the beach" and "near the beach" so it just feels excessive. The slider bar is better in mobile than in desktop though and that does make it a bit better.
The design of the site is in my opninion quite good. Looking at the landing page for AirBNB from 2008 and 2015 it is very clear that they have found out what is important in their design, they no longer need the "oh look at that!" type landing page that they had in 2015. Where they used selected photos and places to try and interest you. As they have a bigger userbase they have the possibility to "bombard" you with choices, and honestly i really appreciate that in a website, no "click here to get started", it's more like an app. No introduction just giving you the wheel.


# Middle page search

While researching I found that most of the landing pages to booking sites followd this type of set up, and it's very similar to the Airbnb site from 2015. These sites include:
+ Booking.com
+ Vrbo
+ Plumguide
+ Hometogo
+ Agoda

Traditional sites
+ Hotels.com
+ Expedia.no

This seems to be the traditional way of booking stites, it has a large search functionality to grab the attention when you come on the websites. Where a variant of the question "where do you want to go?" is placed in the searchfield. Followed by the time of the stay, and then how many is going to stay. A large search button based on the main color of the site usually blue.
